Constance - Dynamic Django settings
===================================

A Django app for storing dynamic settings in pluggable backends (Redis and
Django model backend built in) with an integration with the Django admin app.

**Deprecated: this fork was made to add support for Django 1.8. Upstream repo now support it so don't use this fork anymore.**
